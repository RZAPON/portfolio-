            <p>I will be focused.Focus is so important because it is the gateway to all thinking: perception, memory,
                learning, reasoning, problem solving, and decision making. Without good focus, all aspects of your
                ability to think will suffer. ... Here's a simple reality: if you can't focus effectively, you can't
                think effectively.</p>
